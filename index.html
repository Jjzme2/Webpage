        I enjoy coding using Unity3D, and have an
        <a href="https://jjzme2.itch.io/math-problems">educational game</a>
        in very early alpha release on itch.io.
        <br>
        <br>
        While my primary focus is video game development, I really like to code, whatever that means.
        So I bring a breadth of understanding with coding, including:

      <h4>I definitely do have a lot to learn with programming, and I'm excited
        to continue my journey. It is worth mentioning though, that while
        I am learning, I bring to the table a few other qualities.</h4>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>I'm smart.</h3>üß†
        </li>
        <p>While there have been initial learning curves with some of my careers in the past, I work through it
          and in that, find a lot of success.</p>
        <li>
          <h3>I adapt and grow.</h3>üå±
        </li>
        <p>Something important in that, is I then have the understanding to teach.
          I believe only through struggle can we grow. I choose to see struggle as a challenge
          challenges give you the change to grow, once you can get beyond the initial
          disappointment that is often associated with what, then, seems like a problem. </p>
        <li>
          <h3>I'm Patient.</h3>üï¢
        </li>
        <p>
          I understand that good things come to those who wait, likewise, I also understand that the early bird catches the worm.
          I believe in balance, I think that everything comes with a degree of good and bad, or, rather, everything has
          benefit and loss with it, depending on perspective.
        <p>Having been challenged in the past, I've grown, I've been able to determine a lot about myself, a valuable part of that
          is understanding why I failed, and why then, others might too.</p>
        </p>
        <li>
          <h3>I work well under pressure.</h3>ü•µ
        </li>
        <p>
          Previously, I've primarily been working in a fast-paced environment, and in the times where it was busier, I've learned to
          keep my cool; that getting overwhelmed when the pressure is on only increases the liklihood of messing up. While I do try to
          perform well at all times, I do notice a fair improvement, when the pressure is on.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h3>
            I love. ‚ù§
          </h3>
        </li>
        <p>
          I'm a very positive person, I would fairly say 80% of the time, at a minimum, I'm a very happy person
          I have a lot to be thankful for, reference the picture at the top of my daughter and me. I also have
          an amazing wife, who supports me in everything I do, and is someone who wants to and understands
          growing in love. Someone who I love, and can love, and in return loves me, and can be loved by me, but
          still wants to grow, and help me grow. Additionally, I have the most adorable two year old son in the world.

        <p>I digress. I love life, it is a very enjoyable experience, hardships and all. Like I said before, I think
          everything has good and bad, I choose to see the good, I think that is one of our greatest privileges as humans,
          being able to make that choice.</p>
        </p>
        <li>
          <h3>I have a unique outlook on life.</h3>üí°
        </li>
        <p>I've heard a lot that it's refreshing, admittedly, at times, I've also heard that I'm more than is needed, but always well-intending.
          I think a lot of that has been displayed in the previous paragraphs, so I won't go much more into it here.

      <ul>
        <li>I work hard</li>
        <li>I'm dedicated to a fault</li>
        <li>I'm positive energy</li>
        <li>I want to grow, and I will work towards growing.</li>
        <li>I will put forth every effort I have to develop as a person and developer</li>

        <li>I know that others are also worth just as much</li>
